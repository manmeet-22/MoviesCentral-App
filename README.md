# MoviesCentral-App
This app shows the latest movies.

Here is a fully functional and colorful android app which I made from scratch for Android Developer Nanodegree program.

## Features

With the app, you can:
* Discover the most popular or the most rated movies
* Save favorite movies locally and can watch them in the favourites tab
* Watch trailers
* Read reviews
* View Cast
* Watch Movie Thumbnails

## How to Work with the Source

This app uses [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API to retrieve movies.
You must provide your own API key in order to build the app. When you get it, just paste it in the `ApiUtility.java` file:
    ```
    public static final String API_KEY = "Your Api Key";
    ```
